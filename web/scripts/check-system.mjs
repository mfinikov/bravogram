Usage: node scripts/check-system.mjs [options] [--files <file>...]

With no options it runs the fixture self-test, then checks the repo against the
allowlist. Exit 0 clean, 1 on findings or a failed self-test, 2 on bad setup.

Options
  --root <dir>         repo root. Default: the git root of the first file given to
                       --files, --rehash or --save-stock, else of the current
                       folder, else the current folder. Pass it in a monorepo
                       whose app is not the git root
  --config <file>      config (default: scripts/check-system.config.json)
  --self-test          run only the fixtures, from --fixtures <dir> or from
                       fixtures/check-system/ beside this script. The standard
                       fixtures stay in the skill folder: --self-test --fixtures
                       <skill>/fixtures/check-system proves this copy
  --fixtures <dir>     the fixture folder for the self-test
  --no-self-test       skip the fixtures. With no fixture folder beside the script,
                       the default run skips them anyway
  --files <f>...       check only these files. The allowlist still applies
  --no-allowlist       ignore the allowlist, so every finding fails. Shows all a file holds
  --init               write a starter config guessed from the repo. Refuses to overwrite
  --init-allowlist     write the allowlist from today's findings. Refuses to overwrite
  --shrink-allowlist   lower allowlist counts to what is found now. Never raises one
  --prune-allowlist    drop allowlist entries that match no finding now: a fixed
                       literal, a deleted file, a retired rule. Counts that still
                       match stay. The close runs it before --left
  --hash-stock         fill empty sha256 cells in the drift list, for every status
  --rehash <f>... --note "<why>"
                       record the current hash of these drift-list files after a
                       reviewed edit, and write the note into each row. The note
                       is required
  --save-stock <f> <upstream>
                       save upstream's copy of a customized ui file as
                       <stockDir>/<f>.stock. <upstream> is a plain file or a
                       registry item JSON, such as \`npx shadcn@latest view <item>\`. Findings
                       on lines identical to a stock line are upstream's, not drift
  --left               after the scan, print what the allowlist still holds, by
                       file and rule. The close counts come from this output
  --changed <ref>      report only findings on lines added or changed since the merge
                       base of <ref> and HEAD, uncommitted and untracked files
                       included. The allowlist still applies: an allowlisted
                       literal is reported only past its count. For pull requests
  --diff <file>        take the changed lines from a unified diff instead of git
                       ("-" reads stdin)
  --warn               report findings as warnings and always exit 0. Output is
                       GitHub annotations (::warning file=,line=::) when
                       GITHUB_ACTIONS is set, else "file:line warning ...". Skips
                       the self-test. The blocking check stays a separate run
  --format <f>         github or plain, overriding the guess --warn makes
  --summary <file>     also append every finding and warning to <file> as a Markdown
                       table. Pass $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, so nothing is lost past
                       the annotation cap
  --ratchet [<file>]   count findings per rule over the whole repo and compare with
                       <file> (JSON, rule id to count; default
                       scripts/check-ratchet.json). Fails only when a count
                       rises. Writes the file when it is missing. With --warn, a
                       rise is a warning and the exit is 0
  --ratchet-update     with --ratchet, lower the file's counts to what is found now
                       once a count falls. Never raises one
  --explain <rule-id>  print the rule, why it matters and the fix
  --list-rules         print rule id and rule, tab separated
  --list-blind-spots   print what the check cannot see, one line each
  --json               print findings as JSON
  --help               this text

                 holding "Don't:" or the ban's own id describes the ban and passes
  banDocs        folders of Markdown pages the bans also scan  ["docs/system"]
  names          outside product names the shipped docs should not carry, each a
                 string or {"name","why"}. A hit in a banDocs page is a
                 rule/outside-name warning, which never fails the check

Allowlist: {"<file>": {"<rule>": {"<literal>": <count>}}}. A count may instead be
{"count": <n>, "removeBy": "YYYY-MM-DD"}. Once the date has passed, every run prints
a warning for that row. It never fails the check.

Raw-value, arbitrary-value and px findings name the nearest token: color tokens for
the property's job (text, background, border) by deltaE OK, lengths by kind
(space, radius, type, size) by distance in px.

Fixture files end in .fixture (button.tsx.fixture), so tsc, lint and the
framework never compile them. The self-test reads them under their inner name.
A repo keeps only fixtures for rules the run added, in scripts/fixtures/check-system/.`;
